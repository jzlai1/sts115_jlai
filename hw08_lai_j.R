# emf - good job! see comments below

# Directions:

# This file contains homework questions for the lecture on data visualization.
# Questions appear as comments in the file. 

# Please see the Grading Criteria Canvas Page for specific guidance on what
# we expect from you regarding assignment responses.

# Once you have completed the assignment, follow the Submission Instructions 
# on Canvas Pages section to add, commit, and push this to your GitHub repository. 

# Some questions have multiple parts - make sure to read carefully and
# answer all of them. The majority of points lost in homework come from
# careless skipping over question parts.

# Write an R code snippet that uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of 
# dates in the string variable text that are in the format "dd/mm/yyyy" and replace 
# them with the format "yyyy-mm-dd". The text variable contains multiple dates in 
# the "dd/mm/yyyy" format interspersed with other text. For example, if text is 
# "The event was held on 23/04/2021 and the next event will be on 05/10/2022.", 
# the output should be "The event was held on 2021-04-23 and the next 
# event will be on 2022-10-05.".
#
# Ensure your code dynamically handles the text variable, meaning it should work 
# for any string input following the mentioned pattern. Use relevant functions from 
# the stringr package, any other package, or base R for your solution.

library(stringr)

sample_text <- c("this is a test. please convert the date 24/03/2024 and 31/01/2019.")

str_replace_all(sample_text, "(0[1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|3[0-1])/(0[1-9]|1[0-2])/(\\d{4})", "\\3-\\2-\\1")


# Write an R code snippet that assigns the string "I am here.  Am I alive" to
# a variable "x" and uses an Escape Sequence to put a newline between the two
# sentences.

x <- "I am here.\nAm I alive"
cat(x)

# Write an R code snippet that assings the following string to the variable "y:"
#
# She said, "Hi!"


y <- "She said, \"Hi\""
cat(y)

# [TEXT ANSWER] Explain what a Text Encoding is:


# Text encoding is a process that represents certain text characters in a form so that they can be stored and transmitted amongst computers and other digital platforms.


# Write an R code snippet that creates a vector of all containing the words in the string, 
# "He wanted to say hello but was afraid".  Then use the stringr library to locate any 
# occurences of the string "hello" in your vector.

input <- "He wanted to say hello but was afraid"

vec <- strsplit(input, "\\s+")[[1]] # emf - good - annotations would be helpful here 

hello <- str_detect(vec, "hello")

print(hello)



# Section "15.8 Corpus Analytics" of the reader contains a tutorial on performing
# corpus analytics on a Document Term Matrix of 19th Century novels.  A Document Term
# Matrix is a matrix that contains information about the number of times that a work 
# appears in each text in a corpus.  In class, we calculated the word frequencies for
# the novel _Wuthering Heights_.  There "data" folder in the Files area of Canvas for 
# this course contains a file names dtm.rds which holds this type of count information
# for every normalized text in the collection of novels we worked with in class. 
# First, download that file to your couse working directory.   Then, recreate a working
# version of the code in section 15.8 of the reader below.  Note that before you can 
# use the code in that section you will need to read dtm.rds file into the dtm variable
# so that the data ih the DTM is available to the rest of the code.

dtm <- readRDS("dtm.rds")
manifest <- read.csv("C19_novels_manifest.csv", row.names = 1)

# emf - section 15.8 of the course reader also includes the subsections 15.8.1 - 15.8.3
